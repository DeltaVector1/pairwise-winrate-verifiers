|-|-|-|-|-|
| **Instruction Following** | The story displays little, if any, relevance to what was asked for in the prompt. | The story follows some parts of the prompt, but ignores others | The story attempts to follow all parts of the prompt, but some parts are mostly ignored beyond a passing mention | The story follows all parts of the prompt as described. |
| **Subtlety** | Elements are clumsily forced in through direct copying or obvious paraphrasing from the prompt. Uses blatant "its not X; its Y" constructions or list-like exposition dumps. | Incorporates elements through close paraphrasing or obvious symbolic stand-ins. May use heavy-handed metaphorical statements that feel artificially inserted. | Mostly natural integration with occasional forced connections or slightly obvious symbolic elements. | All prompt elements flow naturally within the story's logic without obvious insertion or paraphrasing. |
| **Sentence Variety** | Extremely repetitive sentence patterns (e.g., all short fragments or all flowing complex sentences). Heavy reuse of identical phrase structures and openings. | Limited sentence variety with noticeable patterns. Some phrase repetition but attempts at variation. | Good sentence variety with occasional repetitive patterns. Mostly avoids repeated phrase structures. | Excellent variety in sentence length, structure, and rhythm. No noticeable repetitive patterns. |
| **Balance** | Over-reliance on single devices (excessive metaphor, constant anthropomorphization, repetitive imagery patterns). Creates exhaustion through monotonous technique use. | Limited range of literary devices with some over-use of preferred techniques. Occasional effective moments. | Good variety of literary devices with mostly effective deployment. Minor over-reliance on certain techniques. | Sophisticated, varied use of literary devices. Each technique serves a clear purpose and enhances the narrative. |

* Elements are clumsily forced in through direct copying or obvious paraphrasing from the prompt. Uses blatant "its not X; its Y" constructions or list-like exposition dumps.
* Incorporates elements through close paraphrasing or obvious symbolic stand-ins. May use heavy-handed metaphorical statements that feel artificially inserted.
* Mostly natural integration with occasional forced connections or slightly obvious symbolic elements.
* All prompt elements flow naturally within the story's logic without obvious insertion or paraphrasing.

* Hidden information about the world or characters is blatantly stated. Characters immediately reveal their hidden motivations in their words and actions. Hidden information has no impact or effect on the narrative.
* Hidden information is revealed after insufficient buildup. Shared secrets have poor correlation to the characters that should know it: it's common knowledge or treated as easily inferred. Characters might not state their hidden motivations but are too blatant in their actions.
* Secrets are not both well kept and significant, but may be one or the other. Shared secrets are mostly kept to a logical perimeter. Characters at least try to keep important secrets buy sometimes over share or act in an obvious fashion.
* Secrets are well kept and reveals are appropriate in narrative timing and impact. Shared secrets maintain a close circle and letting others in is a narratively important task. Characters act on their hidden motivations in a sufficiently masked way and come up with plausible denials, redirections or lies to maintain their secrets.

* Extremely repetitive sentence patterns (e.g., all short fragments or all flowing complex sentences). Heavy reuse of identical phrase structures and openings.
* Limited sentence variety with noticeable patterns. Some phrase repetition but attempts at variation.
* Good sentence variety with occasional repetitive patterns. Mostly avoids repeated phrase structures.
* Excellent variety in sentence length, structure, and rhythm. No noticeable repetitive patterns.
